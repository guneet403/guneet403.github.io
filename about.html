  <p style="color:violet ">hello I am Guneet kaur and i study in grade 8 .I live with my mom, my dad, and my little sister. My hobbies are cooking and sketching. 
I like to cook because it is my favorite thing to do. Creating new food and tasting it makes me feel really happy. I want to enhance my learning 
in cooking.I like sketching because it is the perfect pass time for me. When ever i want a break from the phone screen i just open my sketch book
and i sketch a drawing of something. And the reson i want to learn to read and write in punjabi is because i can speeck it really well but 
  i dont read and write that well. I was born in india but i was raised in canada.</p>
