  <p >hello I am Guneet kaur and i study in grade 8 .I live with my mom, my dad, and my little sister.  In this portfolio you will learn about me and my interests. I am a grade 8 student. This portfolio is assigment given in my information tech class
    . I enjoy cooking and drawing, and I’m currently learning to read and write in Punjabi. I find a lot of joy in expressing myself creatively, whether it’s through food, art, or language. I’m passionate about culture and communication, which is why I love exploring different cuisines and artistic styles. I also enjoy spending time learning new skills and diving into projects that challenge me. Whether I’m sketching something new or experimenting in the kitchen, I’m always looking for ways to grow and try something different.
My hobbies are cooking and sketching. 
I like to cook because it is my favorite thing to do. Creating new food and tasting it makes me feel really happy. I want to enhance my learning 
in cooking.I like sketching because it is the perfect pass time for me. When ever i want a break from the phone screen i just open my sketch book
and i sketch a drawing of something. And the reson i want to learn to read and write in punjabi is because i can speeck it really well but 
  i dont read and write that well. I was born in india but i was raised in canada.</p>
