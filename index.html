<p> In this portfolio you will learn about me and my interests. I am a grade 8 student. This portfolio is assigment given in my information tech class
    . I enjoy cooking and drawing, and I’m currently learning to read and write in Punjabi. I find a lot of joy in expressing myself creatively, whether it’s through food, art, or language. I’m passionate about culture and communication, which is why I love exploring different cuisines and artistic styles. I also enjoy spending time learning new skills and diving into projects that challenge me. Whether I’m sketching something new or experimenting in the kitchen, I’m always looking for ways to grow and try something different.
